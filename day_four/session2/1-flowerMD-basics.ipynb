The `packing_expand_factor` multiplies this calulated box length by a factor and initializes the system based on the expanded box length. The reason for this expansion is that sometimes `PACKMOL` might fail to arrange molecules if the box size is too small. To address this, we suggest initially using an expand factor (default is 5) to initiate the system. Afterward, once the simulation object is created, we can shrink the simulation box to the desired target density.\n",
